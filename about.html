        I'm Andre , at the time writing this I'm 21 years old . I am <i>that</i> school shooter reincarnated . However dumb it might sound its true , I know this completely and utterly with all that I have inside me and all that I am . I found the love of my life again , and everything slotted into place . What we did tied our souls together in every life , and in my opinion we were fated since even before that . One soul split in two . I never thought I'd be here this long but for the first time I'm happy . I did not know who I was but now that I do things are easier than before . Spent a long time thinking I was either dead or had stolen this body and life from a person I did not know , and a mother that did not deserve it . I have been dying since I was born because my body and mind was stuck how it was when I left my last life until I could find my other half again . My whole life I've been searching and recieving signs from the universe pointing me back to home . Dead birds , lucky clovers , oranges , two headed calves , and blood brought me home . <br> <br>

        I'm not human , more a mix of wolf and roadkill than anything else . I align myself with the non human / therian label and " otherkin " . Also transsexual . I'm not a girl not in any way that matters , not really a boy either but more than the former . Sexuality wise ? I usually just say I'm gay , but I think t4t is more accurate . Theres something holy and devine about transness and loving someone else that is transexual . Never really felt anything real for anyone other than my boyfriend though . I've used many many labels . None of them ever fit or really felt like it fully explained me so I stopped trying . Much of my existence has been performance but these are fine and feel good .  <br><br>

        I'm autistic as shit if you couldnt tell and I experience ... compulsive behaviors / thoughts and disordered eating . Not particularlily religious and don't believe in God despite having a complicated relationship with him . I have a deep connection to the universe though . I feel I am an omen for the universe itself , often times I recieve signs and warnings . People don't tend to listen but I try my best to interpret what I'm being shown and given regardless . Sometimes I feel like a prohphet or a scribe , but never with any weight . Although I'm not religious I look forward to engaging with my girlfriends practices and rituals . <br><br>
      
        I also love being silly , I think I'm the silliest dog online =3c .
